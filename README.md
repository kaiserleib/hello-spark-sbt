## hello-spark-sbt
A Hello World project using the Spark java web framework and SBT

## Why?
Traditionally at sofi we've used the Play! framework, and I've grown comfortable with sbt over maven. However, for our microservices, Play! provides a number of features that we're just not using. Spark is a very promising lightweight Java web framework, and it appears to give us nothing that we don't need.
